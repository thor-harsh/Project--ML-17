**In this project we will build the Model Eclat for Associate Rule Mining and do the Market Basket Analysis on different items in the dataset**.<br></br>  


  Eclat algorithm is data mining algorithm which is used to find frequent items. 
  As we already know, some association rule mining algorithm uses horizontal data format and some of them uses a vertical data format for generation of frequent itemsets. 
  Eclat can not use horizontal database.<br></br>

  The ECLAT algorithm stands for Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal.
  It is one of the popular methods of Association Rule mining. It is a more efficient and scalable version of the Apriori algorithm.
  While the Apriori algorithm works in a horizontal sense imitating the Breadth-First Search of a graph, the ECLAT algorithm works in a vertical manner just like the Depth-First Search of a graph.
  This vertical approach of the ECLAT algorithm makes it a faster algorithm than the Apriori algorithm.<br></br>

  
**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
